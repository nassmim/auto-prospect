# Migrations

This project uses **Drizzle ORM** for all database migrations.

Migrations are stored in `/drizzle/migrations/` and managed by Drizzle exclusively.

This folder (`/supabase/migrations/`) is intentionally kept empty to prevent Supabase CLI from auto-applying migrations.

## Workflow

See main README or CLAUDE.md for the complete Drizzle migration workflow.
